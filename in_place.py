In-place file processing

The ``in_place`` module provides Python classes for reading & writing a file
"in-place": data that you write ends up at the same filepath that you read
from, and ``in_place`` takes care of all the necessary mucking about with
temporary files for you.

    An abstract base class for reading from & writing to a file "in-place"
    (with data that you write ending up at the same filepath that you read
    from) that takes care of all the necessary mucking about with temporary
    files.  Concrete subclasses only need to implement `open_read` and
    `open_write` in order to define how & with what options the files are
    opened, and `InPlaceABC` takes care of the rest.

    Two concrete subclasses are provided with `InPlaceABC`: `InPlace`, for
    working with text files, and `InPlaceBytes`, for working with binary files.

    :param string name: The path to the file to open & edit in-place (resolved
        relative to the current directory at the time of the instance's
        creation)

    :param string backup: The path at which to save the file's original
        contents once editing has finished (resolved relative to the current
        directory at the time of the instance's creation); if `None` (the
        default), no backup is saved

    :param string backup_ext: A string to append to ``name`` to get the path at
        which to save the file's original contents.  Cannot be empty.
        ``backup`` and ``backup_ext`` are mutually exclusive.

    :param bool delay_open: If `True`, the newly-constructed instance will not
        be open, and the user must either explicitly call the :meth:`open()`
        method or use the instance as a context manager in order to open it.
        If `False` (the default), the instance will be automatically opened as
        soon as it is constructed.

    :param bool move_first: If `True`, the original (input) file will be moved
        to a temporary location before opening, and the output file will be
        created in its place.  If `False` (the default), the output file will
        be created at a temporary location, and neither file will be moved or
        deleted until :meth:`close()` is called.
